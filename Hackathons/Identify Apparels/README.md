# Identify the Apparels(Analytics Vidhya)

## Problem Statement

More than 25% of entire revenue in E-Commerce is attributed to apparels & accessories. A major problem they face is categorizing these apparels from just the images especially when the categories provided by the brands are inconsistent. This poses an interesting computer vision problem which has caught the eyes of several deep learning researchers.

Fashion MNIST is a drop-in replacement for the very well known, machine learning hello world - MNIST dataset which can be checked out at ‘Identify the digits’ practice problem. Instead of digits, the images show a type of apparel e.g. T-shirt, trousers, bag, etc. The dataset used in this problem was created by Zalando Research. More details can be found at this link.
